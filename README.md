# Information
With this program you can create a random graph or
use one of your interest.

You can test search algorithms in a graph, and see if
there is a solution, from a node A to another B, and
if the algorithm is informative then we will need a
graph with heuristics and costs. If not, you just
do not need any heuristics and costs.

A graph is formed with:
  - sources [] -> nodes where the arrow starts
  - targets [] -> nodes which the arrow points
  - heuristics [] -> the heuristic of a graph
  - weight [] -> the costs of weight reference to
      the arrow that goes from sources[x] to targets[x]

`If there is no heuristic applied then it is a non informed algorithm`

#### Types of algorithms:

| Non-informative | Informative |
|---|---|
| Deep search | Climb algorithm |
| Range search | First better algorithm |
| Branch & Bound | A* |
